This API was created to serve to part of the ecosystem REFIBRA(Repositório Filatélico Brasileiro). It was concepted to be a bridge between a databese using Apache Fuseki and a frontend aplication that represent a site to research knoledgment in a differente way. I builded this API using languagens and tools that i work nowadays to way to be simple and replicatable on differents enviropments. Hence it was developed in .NET Core 2.1 (https://github.com/dotnet/core) using IDE Visual Studio Code.
